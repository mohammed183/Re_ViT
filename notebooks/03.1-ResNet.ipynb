    "## Fine tuning the ResNet model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to fine-tune a pre-trained model for image classification tasks. We will use the **ResNet-152x4** model, which is a deep convolutional neural network with *152* layers and *4* times more channels than the standard **ResNet-152**. This model was trained on the **ImageNet-21k** dataset, which is a large-scale dataset with about *14 million images and 21,000 classes*. We will fine-tune this model on different datasets that are commonly used for image classification, such as **ImageNet-1k**, **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **Oxford Pets** and **Oxford flowers**. We will save the results to compare them with the **ViT** later.\n",

    "The function `get_res_loaders` is a helper function that can create the dataloaders for *training* and *testing* the **ResNet** model on different image classification datasets. The function takes two arguments: `dataset` and `batch_size`. The `dataset` argument is a string that specifies the name of the dataset to use, such as ‚Äúimagenet‚Äù, ‚Äúcifar10‚Äù, ‚Äúcifar100‚Äù, ‚Äúoxford_pets‚Äù, or ‚Äúflowers_102‚Äù. The `batch_size` argument is an integer that specifies the number of images to feed to the model at each iteration. We can also adjust the `batch_size` argument according to the GPU we have. The function returns three dataloaders: one for the training data, one for the development data and one for the testing data. The development splits are as the following: 10% for Pets and Flowers, 2% for CIFAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses a dictionary called `known_dataset_sizes` to store the image sizes for each dataset. It also uses a transformation function called `normalize_transform` to normalize the images using the channel means. The function then creates two different transformation functions for the training and testing data, using the PyTorch transforms module.\n",

    "**üåÄ Reproducibility Challenge: Image resolution**  \n",
    "One challenge that we face in this notebook was the discrepancy between the image resolution used in the paper and the code. The paper reported using a resolution of **384x384** pixels for the ResNet models, but the code provided different resolutions for different datasets. In the code they used **128x128** for CIFAR datasets, **224x224** for Oxford datasets and **480x480** for ImageNet-1k dataset. To determine the best resolution, we would need to try all four resolutions, which is computationally expensive. However, this step was completed beforehand and it was found that the resolutions in `known_dataset_sizes` yield good results but may not be the optimal ones.\n",
